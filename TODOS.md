TODOS:

- Add stadiums for away games without stadiums
  - Update location coordinates for these games
  - Update weather weather for these games
- Ensure location coordinates are accurate
  - For older stadiums that don't show up right away on Google Maps, I just picked the center of the
    city or whatever default football stadium exists now, even if it had a different name.
- Ensure Navy games have proper home / away designations
- Manually add weather for post-1935 games
- Update weather script to handle games further than 7 days out (e.g. bowl or post-bye week games)
- Add flag to indicate neutral site games
